# Single Sign On with Authgear

## What is Single-sign-on

- Single-sign-on (SSO) is defined as login once, logged in all apps.
- The end-user is not required to enter their authentication credentials again.
- The end-users expect to logout from all the apps by clicking 1 button too. (logout from this computer)

There are two types of SSO in Authgear. [Browser SSO](oidc-sso-browser.md) and [Device SSO](oidc-sso-device.md). Please read the corresponding documents for details.
