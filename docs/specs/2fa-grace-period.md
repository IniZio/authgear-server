## Abstract

In order to enforce 2FA, we will provide a grace period for users to enroll in 2FA after they have signed up.

After the grace period, the user will be required to enroll in 2FA before they can sign in.

## Configuration

By default, no grace period is provided. User without 2FA must contact admin to login after [2FA mode](./user-model.md#secondary-authenticator) is set to `required`.

For new users, the grace period starts from the time the user is created, whereas for existing users, the grace period starts from when the grace period is enabled.

### Global Grace Period

Global grace period can be enabled for forcing users to enroll in 2FA upon login.

```yaml
authentication:
  secondary_authentication_mode: "required"
  secondary_authentication_rollout:
    global_grace_period_enabled_since: "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    global_grace_period_days: 30
```

### Per-user Grace Period

Regardless of the global grace period, a per-user grace period can be granted for 10 days by default, or a custom duration can be specified:

```yaml
authentication:
  secondary_authentication_mode: "required"
  secondary_authentication_rollout:
    per_user_grace_period_days: 10
```

It is possible to extend the grace period of a user multiple times or cancel immediately through Admin Portal / GraphQL API.

### Customized Authentication Flow

Customized authentication flow can use `enrollment_allowed: true` to allow enrolling any of the following authenticators before proceeding.

```yaml
authentication_flow:
  login_flows:
    - name: internal_user
      steps:
        - type: identify
          one_of:
            - identification: phone
            - identification: email
        - type: authenticate
          one_of:
            - authentication: primary_password
        - type: authenticate
          # Requires user to satisfy one of the following authentication.
          optional: false # or null
          # If the end-user has no applicable authentication method,
          # then enrollment will be required before proceeding.
          # enrollment_allowed by default is false, meaning user with no applicable method beforehand will be blocked from proceeding.
          enrollment_allowed: true
          one_of:
            - authentication: secondary_totp
            - authentication: recovery_code
```

#### Notes

- Currently only secondary authenticators are supported for enrollment.
- `enrollment_allowed` is ignored when `optional` is `true` to match default behaviour.
