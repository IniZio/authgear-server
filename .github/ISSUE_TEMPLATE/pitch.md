## Problem

> What’s the use case? What have we seen that motivates us to work on this?

## Appetite

> How much time do we want to spend and how does that constrain the solution? (Usually 2 weeks or 6 weeks)

## Solution

> The solution, if involved UI changes, include Fat Marker Sketches

## Success definition

> Based on the “Problem” statement, define how we know if the feature is successful using event tracking.
>
> Event definition: Event name, Action that triggered the event, Which page the user will perform this action, Event properties

## Rabbit holes

> Details about the solution worth calling out to avoid problems

## No-goes

> Functionality or use cases we intentionally aren’t covering to fit the appetite
